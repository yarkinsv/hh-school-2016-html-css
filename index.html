                                One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed
                                in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his
                                head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into
                                stiff sections.

                                living room that was used by everyone, and so the door to this room was often kept
                                closed in the evening. But Gregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had,
                                after all, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without the family
                                having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time, though, the
                                charwoman left the door.
